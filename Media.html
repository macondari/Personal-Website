        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a first-year Computer Engineering candidate known for my detail-oriented approach, strong work ethic, and passion for technology. During high school and my first two terms at the University of Waterloo, I consistently excelled academically, achieving top ten honors and earning both the Presidentâ€™s Scholarship of Distinction and the Embark FIRST Alumni scholarship.
        </p>
        <p>
            My diverse experiences include thriving in both team-based and independent work environments. From part-time jobs, I've learned to take initiative and excel under minimal supervision. These experiences have prepared me to work on collaborative projects while also delivering results independently.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've navigated a variety of academic and professional projects, And developed skills working with Unity, C#, C++, Python, and of course CSS and HTML. Notably, my internship with the Hamilton Wentworth Catholic District School Board's IT Department exposed me to a range of software applications. I contributed to projects such as migrating student data profiles from Trillium to Aspen, enhancing my proficiency in working with diverse software environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my first co-op at the University of Waterloo, I explored the applications of VR in education and expanded my skills in Unity and C#. Additionally, I refined my UI design abilities through developing projects for The Meta Occulus 2 and 3 VR headsets.
