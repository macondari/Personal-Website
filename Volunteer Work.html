            <h3>During my time with the Dominican Republic Education And Medical Supply (DREAMS) program, I was one of 18 students selected to work in the Dominican Republic. As part of a team, I helped organize, promote, and run multiple fundraisers to be put towards supplies to build an aqueduct and basic necessities to donate such as medical supplies and clothes. During the week-long stay in the city of San Jose De Ochoa, I worked on tasks such as moving cinderblocks, making cement, cutting metal bars, and moving buckets of gravel/water.</h3>
            <!-- Essay section-->
            <p>If someone were to ask me about my favorite part of Dreams, I honestly couldn't choose just one. Every day was filled with moments that I know will stay with me forever. The trip started with a sleepless 4 hour flight followed by a six-hour bus ride to San Jose de Ochoa, (yes, six hours on a bus) but like any road trip the team was lively with activities like old camp games, lively Spanish music on the bus speakers, and a pit stop at McDonald's, the journey got off to an unforgettable start. We spent our first night at a convent in the city before venturing up to a mountain town to begin our work. </p>
            <p> Our main task was constructing an aqueduct for the mountain town, crucial for collecting rainwater. With guidance from a local civil engineer, our team formed an assembly line up the steep slopes, stacking cinderblocks and mixing cement. The work was hard, but I had tried my best to be prepared physically, squeezing in workouts on the Stairmaster after my shifts at the pool. </p>
            <p> Beyond the labor, I cherished the moments spent with locals. During lunch breaks, I found joy in pushing local children up and down hills in a wheelbarrow that had stored our supplies. For the kids, these rides were equivalent to a rollercoaster with how steep the roads were. One memorable day, we played baseball with the locals, where I quickly realized my talents lay elsewhere. But nonetheless I had a lot of fun and was able to gift my glove to the town before I left along with other clothes and supplies I had brought. </p>
            <p>As our time in the mountains drew to a close, a small group of us ventured on a hike down to a reservoir lake nestled at the base of the mountain peak. We could see the lake from our dining area everyday yet we were the first group to make the adventure to the bottom, and I quickly found out why. The breathtaking view from the bottom of the mountain, captured in the slideshow above, made every step worth it. The uphill return hike however, was challenging and nothing compared to the stairmaster, leaving me a sweaty mess at the end, though I would definitely do it again!</p>
            <p>Reflecting on these experiences, I am amazed by the impact our work had on the community. It wasn't just about building an aqueduct; it was about forging connections, embracing challenges, and learning from each other. The fun we had was undeniable, but more importantly, it  was the significance of our mission. Dreams was not just a journey but, it was a testament to the power of teamwork and the spirit of giving back.</p>

            <!--essay section-->
            <p> Camp has been a big part of my life since I was young. I started volunteering at Cave Springs in summer 2019. The training week was a blastâ€”overnight hikes, high ropes, and learning how to organize games for campers were all part of it. </p>
            <p>Since then, I've volunteered about 1-2 weeks every year, even during COVID-19 when I helped out during March break, Christmas break, and summer camps. I mainly worked with the the day camp staff, using my lifeguard skills for pool time and canoeing. In the evenings, I pitched in with washing dishes, cleaning up, and looking after overnight groups while their counselors took breaks. </p>
            <p> Day camp was the best placement for me, being a lifeguard meant I could be around for pool activities and canoeing, which I loved. One of my favourite camp activities was "Counselor Paint," where kids would paint us counselors with diluted acrylics and soap. One year, I was stained bright blue all day and was since dubbed "the Smurf counselor" by the kids. </p>
            <p> Overall, my time at camp was a blast. It taught me a lot about teamwork and leadership, and I made some great memories along the way. </p>
